# data/

Files like `patterns_X-Y.npy` contain the dataset used to test the dQA dynamics with perceptron hamiltonian. This file origins from numpy arrays.
* `X` is the number of samples contained in the dataset (i.e. rows)
* `Y` is the number of features (i.e. columns)


The directory `benchmark` will contain the data used to evaluate the performances of our models.
